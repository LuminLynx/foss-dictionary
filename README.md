> An open-source glossary project to catalog and explain FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) terms.

## üßê About
The goal of this project is to create a reliable, community‚Äëdriven reference for FOSS terminology ‚Äî from common abbreviations to niche technical jargon ‚Äî to help newcomers and experts alike.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:LuminLynx/foss-dictionary.git
cd foss-dictionary
npm install
npm run dev

---

Defining tech jargon like real humans speak. No buzzword fluff, no corporate nonsense‚Äîjust snappy, clear, occasionally irreverent definitions.

## üîç What‚Äôs This?

A crowdsourced glossary for developers, designers, and the "wait what‚Äôs an API?" crowd. Terms live in `terms.yaml`, served up as searchable cards via `index.html`.

## üß† Tone & Style

- **Human-first:** If a junior dev wouldn‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs wrong.
- **Snark allowed:** Especially for overused buzzwords.
- **Examples matter:** Say it like you'd explain it at 2am during a deployment crisis.

## ‚úä Respect the Stack Manifesto

> We don‚Äôt define ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù as "Application Programming Interface." That‚Äôs a Wikipedia cop-out. We define it the way a dev yells it during standup.  
> This project is built for clarity, not compliance.

## ü§ù Contributing

Fork it. Add your term to `terms.yaml`. Open a PR and tell us why it matters or why it made you laugh.  
Check out `CONTRIBUTING.md` for style rules and a template.

PRs = kudos. Be bold, be respectful, and maybe a little weird.
